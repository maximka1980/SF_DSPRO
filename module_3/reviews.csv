"June 23, 2021",40,Great for rock and roll fans!,"My daughter and I enjoyed dinner here for her 21st birthday. We love looking at all the memorabilia in the multiple dining rooms. The food is good, but it’s the atmosphere we enjoy most!"
"June 30, 2020",40,Always reliable,We ate at the bar after a show. Nachos and salad with a couple of glasses of wine. Just the right stuff at the right time in a energetic atmosphere. Thank you Duane!
"March 17, 2020",50,It's not noisy,"It may sound noisy initially but if you find a good place at the bar, the noises fade away and you can enjoy the company of your partner. One of the best Hard Rock Cafes one finds anywhere in the world."
"March 13, 2020",40,Good burger and unique atmosphere,"I had a very good burger here. The atmosphere is unique but do not expect hard rock music, there were more rap and pop video clips than rock."
"February 24, 2020",30,!00 people for breakfast,"We pre arranged breakfast for 100 people and they opened at 7am for us. Normal opening time is 8am. Standard USA breakfast, nothing special but was good enough for us before a long day in New York."
"February 23, 2020",50,Combo Platter For Two!,"Nice Decor! Share a platter: crumbed chicken, spring rolls, rosti's, chicken wings, brochetta's, onion rings. Great music, visit the shop."
"February 12, 2020",50,Last drinks before home,This is a great hard rock I've never been to a bad 1 in any country but this is 1 of my favourites so far great surroundings and the staff are brilliant
"January 31, 2020",40,Nice meal,"We booked online beforehand as I went a few years ago and there was quite a wait for walk ins. Food was nice, nothing to boast about but yummy. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Reasonably priced. Would go again."
"January 11, 2020",40,Very Good,"Not dissapionted at all. It does what it says. Very nice food, drinks & service. We were very well looked after by our server & this is what we have grown to expect from Hard Rock."
"January 9, 2020",40,Lunch before 3PM performance with our grandson. New Yorkers who had never been to the Hard Rock in NY and delighted.,"We all had the Legendary Burger and it was delicious. Service was friendly and very good. Seating comfortable. Big place but we didn't feel closed in. Novel experience and priced well and according to our grandson, best burger sauce ever!"
"January 3, 2020",50,Christmas break in new york,"Had dinner in here with my daughter and granddaughter. Was very very busy but the food was fast, perfectly cooked and plentiful. The drinks also very tasty."
"December 31, 2019",40,First restuarant of a six day stay in New York,"Was on our '' to do '' list and didn't let us down. You are given a devise that alerts you when your table is ready and while you wait you can view the music memorabilia displays so your wait should not be very long. Service was excellent, I believe our waiter was called Erwin  The food choice was very good, I recommend the ''Legendary Burger'' and my wife the ''Big Cheese Burger'' washed down with a small and pint of Stella larger (the pint being mine)  Fully recommend the experience"
"December 31, 2019",50,A must for a Hard Rock Fan,"I must admit, the whole family is crazy about the Cafe and we always visit, when there is one around. Nearly 30 years ago, I visited one of my first Hard Rocks here in New York but it was up on 57th, if I am correct. Now at Times Square it is a crazy house. Tons of Tourists a huge shop and also a large Restaurant. We had to wait for 1 hour for a table but that was to expect. We love it but if you like a quiet place, keep away.  We enjoeyed it, as the other HRC we went and will continue to visit them."
"December 31, 2019",50,Very good,"you have to go in time to get a table but it's worth it, the special hamburger is delicious as well as the tortillas with dissolved cheese and a very good attention"
"December 30, 2019",40,Amazing ribs!,"A very good meal of fajitas, ribs and salads. The only issue was the dressing missed from all three salads but it was put right quickly. Good service. The ribs were amazing. Really enjoyed."
"December 30, 2019",30,Hard Rock? Why?,"This is the kind of Places that I hate. Noise, automatic people, automatic food ... Is not 4 Me. I have Not good experiences there. In NYC, in Buenos Aires...no no no. Other!!!"
"December 29, 2019",20,Disappointing,"I’ve been to many HRC’s and love the food and experience at them. This was different. We had to wait as we were told there weren’t any tables ready, despite there being plenty of empty tables visible. The options are to wander around the shop (do they make you wait in the hope you’ll buy something here) or get a drink from the bar. The bar surprisingly doesn’t serve half pints (which is a bit cheeky) and there are very few seats (which are grubby) so maybe another ploy to get you to go in the shop? The food was good, I really enjoyed my burger although the meal was expensive....$90 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks. Overall, we came away feeling underwhelmed."
"December 29, 2019",10,Christmas Dinner disappointment.,"Visited Hard Rock Cafe for Christmas Day dinner during a trip to NYC. Booked before hand and received welcoming emails confirming the booking & the Christmas menu on offer. There was no festive spirit when we arrived. Our waitress had the often encountered surly New York attitude and we felt little more than an inconvenience. When I asked about the Christmas menu advertised this was curtly dismissed as “not available here.” The food was a mixture of bland burgers & steaks. Drinks menu was limited and they could not wait to get us to the dessert menu and out of the building. Very poor value. No Christmas cheer meant no tip. NYC has many many more options, Hard Rock Cafe is an appalling gimmick, and not a very good one at that."
"December 29, 2019",50,American breakfast in the heart of Times Square,"Quick, easy, friendly service. Easy place to get a traditional American breakfast if staying in the Times Square area"
"December 29, 2019",20,Disappointing,"I've been to lots of Hard Rock Cafes round the world and this was the most disappointing. The service was pretty poor, the burgers were really small and the whole experience was simply disappointing. I'd recommend going to Hard Rock Cafe just not this one."
"December 28, 2019",40,Food was great...toilets were worst I’ve ever smelt!,"A worthwhile visit to a large hard rock. Booked in advance which was wise as very long queue for those who had not. Good service by Catherine and the children ate and ate. Doggy bag was offered for leftovers.  Visited the ladies loo mid meal. It was dirty, smelly and, to be frank, very shocking for such an expensive place to eat. Shame."
"December 26, 2019",50,Christmas visit,Really friendly staff. Food was well nice and place was nice and clean. Hardly any wait time (we did book a table) very good value for money.

"December 11, 2019",10,Terrible!!!!,"Rude bar attendant. Felt very rushed, waitress seemed to constantly glare at us! Cold food. We have been to many hard rock cafes around the globe and this is by far the worst experience we had!!!"
"December 5, 2019",10,Awful place!,What an overrated venue! The staff were horrible! Abrupt and unpleasant. Food was ok if you like spending over the odds for cold food that tastes like it’s straight out of the microwave! Best part was when we left the building!
